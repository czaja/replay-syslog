# replay-syslog
A simple script for replaying syslog messages from a file.

I wrote this script years ago for the purposes of testing syslog and ArcSight flex-connector parsers.
All it does is it reads a file, changes the timestamp, removes one chained IP address (if present), and
replays it repeatedly to the specified syslog destination. Since others have found this script useful
over the last several years (to my surprise), I thought I'd make it generally available.

Also included: `message-listener.pl`. This is just a light-weight script I wrote for watching the CEF
output from ArcSight connectors.
